## [Unreleased]

### Added ‚úîÔ∏è
* **Unit Tests:** Added unit tests for the `OSDmsS3RepositoryDto`, `OSdmsPathValidator` and `OSdmsWorkspaceManager`. 

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è
* **OSdmsS3RepositoryDto:** Changed the way the name of the file to be added to the zip was constructed. Now the filename instead of constructing the full path separated by `.`, is the same but separated by `_`.

### Fixed üêõ
* **OSdmsPathValidator:** Fixed a bug in the regular expressions of the class validating paths that in some cases was not performing as expected.
* **OSdmsWorkspaceManager:** Fixed a bug that occurred when not setting a workspace. Now if none or none with the name `default` is set, it will default to one with the name set to `default` and the value set to `/{id}`.
* **OSdmsS3RepositoryDto:** Fixed a bug that was caused when the relativeKey and relativePrefix were constructed incorrectly in some cases.

## [1.2.0] - 2023-06-23

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è
* **Events:** The events of the SDMS has been refactored and now there are new events for the service and the s3 engine.

### Fixed üêõ
* **Workspace:** Fixed a bug that caused errors in the handling of DMS files with the S3 engine when a slash is specified at the beginning of the workspace value.
* **OSdmsS3RepositoryDto:** Fixed a bug in the `OSdmsS3RepositoryDto` class that misconstructed the relativeKey and relativePrefix fields causing some errors from the frontend.


## [1.1.0] - 2023-06-21

### Added ‚úîÔ∏è
* **New field on DMS files:** The system has been updated so that when a file is uploaded to the DMS, the creationDate field is added and when information is retrieved from the files, it is also retrieved.
* **Default valure to workspace default:** The default value `/{id}` has been added to the workspace **default**. Now if no workspace is set, these values are the defaults.

### Changed üõ†Ô∏è
* **Code Format:** The code has been formatted.
* **Changelog**: The structure of the CHANGELOG.md file has been modified so that it follows the structure shown at [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

### Fixed üêõ
* **SdmsS3RepositoryDto:** Fixed a bug that occurred in some cases when extracting the prefix from the S3 key.
* **OSdmsS3RepositoryDto:** Fixed a bug in the implementation of the toMap method that caused the EntityResult to sometimes not return certain fields such as size when creating the EntityResult.

## [1.0.0] - 12/06/2023

### Added ‚úîÔ∏è

* **Abstract Controller:** Created an abstract controller that adds endpoints and executes the corresponding methods of
  the DMS system for an entity.
* **S3 Engine:** Implemented an engine to manage the DMS system through the Amazon AWS S3 service API.
* **OSdmsEventListener Annotation:** Added an annotation to set event listeners for available events in the DMS system
  easily.
* **DMS Service Events:** Added an Enum with corresponding events for the DMS service.
* **S3 Repository Events:** Added an Enum with corresponding events for the S3 repository of the S3 engine.
* **OSdmsWorkspace Annotation:** Added an annotation to establish multiple query workspaces on the DMS system for an
  entity.
